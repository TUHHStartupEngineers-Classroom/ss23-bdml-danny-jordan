I don't know why, but the my chapters are hidden. To acess them you have to
go on the top right corner "search" and search for one of my chapters e.g 
"performance...". They you will see the chapter. Click on it.
After clicking everything is okay. Now the menu show the correct chapter names
instead of tidyverse etc.
I changed the .yml file and the .qmd file, but still have this issue nobody 
could resolve
